I’ll give you a gift: take the skin from my stomach and stretch it across your face. Look in the mirror: I see myself through your eyes. My body’s on the ground behind you. You use it to amuse yourself. When you kick it around the room, you feel the impact of your boot in your stomach. Cry for me. Blame me for the fact you no longer recognize yourself. Lying here, I want the air in this room to consume me, to pull my body in behind itself while you stare down at me uncertain if you’ve lost yourself in me.​" "Swans"
"1147" "Your Game" "You’re running your hands along the leather surface of your skin. The sound this makes changes pitch according to the area of your body you touch. Your thighs and your groin generate a low hum – the sound of my corpse releasing dead air when you kick me. Your face generates a continuous high pitched squeal – the sound I make when you burn me. I take you over. You forget yourself in my body. When you chew a piece of skin from your finger, you remember my body in your mouth, my bones cracking between your teeth. I love you. When you lick your hand your sweat tastes like my blood. Conceal yourself. Close yourself off. Pull back into my skin. I’m inside you. The place on the floor where my body decayed left a stain on your memory. That’s the signature of my love for you. You can’t forget me without losing yourself. I’ll never die.​" "Swans"

"1695" "(---) Pt. 3" "We didn't want to go way back around, and uh, follow the road to the trail we came in on. So we start down this, uh, grade. We hadn't gone far at all. We find ourselves standing by washouts that were too deep or a big rock hidden in the buck brush or someplace. So they shut the engines off and do a little reconnoitering, I guess that's a good word. Anyway, they go down the hill and around and finally pick out a route they think they can make, and uh, down the hill we come! That is, we start! Before we get down there, we've encountered a lot of mighty mean places, but that didn't mean a thing to them. Ahem, anyhow, the thing that I'm coming to is that we went up another place, and uh, there was a bunch of brush and uh - buck brush and what have you. When all at once Werner saw a deer! He tried to point it out to me but I couldn't see it, and uh, the boys decided it was a doe and they didn't want it. So, uh, it was up to me to try to find the deer. Well, eventually I did, only because it sneaked out of the brush, and it had a green buck brush or something for a background, then I could see it. Anyway I pulled down on it, and at the crack of the rifle, the little deer fell. I got her right through the heart. We took the heart out, it was practically torn in two!" "Swans"

Uh, the summer's been pretty good so far, I'm looking forward to the day, uh, that is, this summer when, uh Charlie will be out of camp. I don't even know if you know about Charlie, but I have a, uh, kinda of a.. friend, huh, named Charlie Bewman, uh, he's real wild, uh, you would like him if you met him, and uh, he's in this camp. Sounds like a... rehabilitation center for juvenile delinquents, the way he writes about it, some of the jobs they have him do. But he's gonna be out, uh, few more weeks, and, since he's out, we're, uh, gonna really live it up. Maybe you heard, I, I doubt it, but maybe you heard about this big bash they had last weekend, Atlanta International Pop Festival. Janis Joplin, The Who, and, uh, you know, apparently, uh, all the people who were in the Monterey Pop movie, all the big guys, you know, Johnny Rivers, all the big stars, big folk people, uh big soul people, everybody, it was dandy, I didn't get to go to it though, sadly enough. And this afternoon The Grateful Dead was playing at Piedmont Park, four o' clock. But, uh I'm afraid I'll miss out on that too. One thing that sounds groovy, Charlie is a great drummer. He has some friends that are very musically inclined, and I can play the organ a bit, as you know, uh, I enjoy singing. So, um, we're gonna see if we can maybe get up a group!" "Swans"

Frankly, I'm a little in the dark right now about how that will be accomplished. But I'm confident that it will be revealed. The song part, I don't know why somehow I want it to have the feel of one of the ballads from The Rolling Stone's Sticky Fingers or Neil Young's Harvest. But more cinematic somehow if I can use that word. I think it might involve strings. Oh, I guess this song is like a prayer to our creator. I'm not sure" "Swans"
