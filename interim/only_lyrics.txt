"I feel nothing for you. I hold myself down. Keep to yourself. You shouldn’t touch me. My skin peels off my bones. I’ll give you a gift: take the skin from my stomach and stretch it across your face. Look in the mirror: I see myself through your eyes. My body’s on the ground behind you. You use it to amuse yourself. When you kick it around the room, you feel the impact of your boot in your stomach. Cry for me. Blame me for the fact you no longer recognize yourself. Lying here, I want the air in this room to consume me, to pull my body in behind itself while you stare down at me uncertain if you’ve lost yourself in me.​"
"You’re running your hands along the leather surface of your skin. The sound this makes changes pitch according to the area of your body you touch. Your thighs and your groin generate a low hum – the sound of my corpse releasing dead air when you kick me. Your face generates a continuous high pitched squeal – the sound I make when you burn me. I take you over. You forget yourself in my body. When you chew a piece of skin from your finger, you remember my body in your mouth, my bones cracking between your teeth. I love you. When you lick your hand your sweat tastes like my blood. Conceal yourself. Close yourself off. Pull back into my skin. I’m inside you. The place on the floor where my body decayed left a stain on your memory. That’s the signature of my love for you. You can’t forget me without losing yourself. I’ll never die.​"

"We didn't want to go way back around, and uh, follow the road to the trail we came in on. So we start down this, uh, grade. We hadn't gone far at all. We find ourselves standing by washouts that were too deep or a big rock hidden in the buck brush or someplace. So they shut the engines off and do a little reconnoitering, I guess that's a good word. Anyway, they go down the hill and around and finally pick out a route they think they can make, and uh, down the hill we come! That is, we start! Before we get down there, we've encountered a lot of mighty mean places, but that didn't mean a thing to them. Ahem, anyhow, the thing that I'm coming to is that we went up another place, and uh, there was a bunch of brush and uh - buck brush and what have you. When all at once Werner saw a deer! He tried to point it out to me but I couldn't see it, and uh, the boys decided it was a doe and they didn't want it. So, uh, it was up to me to try to find the deer. Well, eventually I did, only because it sneaked out of the brush, and it had a green buck brush or something for a background, then I could see it. Anyway I pulled down on it, and at the crack of the rifle, the little deer fell. I got her right through the heart. We took the heart out, it was practically torn in two!"

"Trying to think of things to say, and really, where to begin. Uh, the summer's been pretty good so far, I'm looking forward to the day, uh, that is, this summer when, uh Charlie will be out of camp. I don't even know if you know about Charlie, but I have a, uh, kinda of a.. friend, huh, named Charlie Bewman, uh, he's real wild, uh, you would like him if you met him, and uh, he's in this camp. Sounds like a... rehabilitation center for juvenile delinquents, the way he writes about it, some of the jobs they have him do. But he's gonna be out, uh, few more weeks, and, since he's out, we're, uh, gonna really live it up. Maybe you heard, I, I doubt it, but maybe you heard about this big bash they had last weekend, Atlanta International Pop Festival. Janis Joplin, The Who, and, uh, you know, apparently, uh, all the people who were in the Monterey Pop movie, all the big guys, you know, Johnny Rivers, all the big stars, big folk people, uh big soul people, everybody, it was dandy, I didn't get to go to it though, sadly enough. And this afternoon The Grateful Dead was playing at Piedmont Park, four o' clock. But, uh I'm afraid I'll miss out on that too. One thing that sounds groovy, Charlie is a great drummer. He has some friends that are very musically inclined, and I can play the organ a bit, as you know, uh, I enjoy singing. So, um, we're gonna see if we can maybe get up a group!"

"It could not withered be"
"But thou thereon did only breathe"
"And sent it back to me"
"Since when it grows and smells, I swear"
"Not of itself, but thee"

"Here is \"A Piece of the Sky.\" My hope is that this long intro will just keep growing and growing. Frankly, I'm a little in the dark right now about how that will be accomplished. But I'm confident that it will be revealed. The song part, I don't know why somehow I want it to have the feel of one of the ballads from The Rolling Stone's Sticky Fingers or Neil Young's Harvest. But more cinematic somehow if I can use that word. I think it might involve strings. Oh, I guess this song is like a prayer to our creator. I'm not sure"

"L: I'm wondering if you're still interested in recording Sonic Youth, or like doing some work with us there"
"W: Uh-huh"
"L: At your place, what..um.. basically whats going on right now is, um.. we're sort of biding our time waiting for Neutral to get together to uh, you know, do our album and all this stuff.."
"W: Right"
"L: And we decided we would like to try and release a quickie single, like as quick as possible, just like 2 or 3 songs.. and um, just do it as inexpensively as possible, and we were thinking about doing it in four-track or something like that"
"W: Right"
"L: And you know I talked to you about these incredible four-track recordings that you were making and so, um, I was wondering if you were actually still interested in working with us on it and doing it at your place.. and you know, if the whole thing goes well, we could probably give you some cash and stuff if it comes out.."
"W: Right"
"L: I mean, I'm not really sure what.. what the deal's gonna be, we're probably gonna be trying to do it as.."
"W: Right, inexpensive.."
"L: ..you know, completely cheap, yeah, like I think you can get a thousand singles for like around $400 or something like that.."
"W: Right"
"L: and uh, so we're figuring out if we can afford to pay for a sleeve or just have 'em white or what..."
"W: Fold em yourself (chuckles)"
"L: What? Yeah, well that's.. don't laugh! That's exactly what.."
"W: Well i did it!"
"L: You did? The Glorious Strangers one?"
"W: Right, the cover cost me $28.."
"L: For how many?"
"W: (chuckles) I still have boxes of them.."
"L: No, but I mean how many did $28 buy, a thousand?"
"W: Yeah"
"L: It did!?"
"W: At least.."
"L: Incredible!"
"W: But I had to fold it all myself"
"L: Yeah but thats okay! Because the place where they sell you the singles wants $200 for like a black and white photo sleeve.. and that's a lot of money!"
"W: Yeah (chuckles)"
"L: You know, I mean if we're trying to do it inexpensively.."
"W: Right, this is the great inexpensive way"
"L: Yeah"
"W: And you know, you can off-set.. you could put..do anything on the cover you want, basically"
"L: Right, right"
"W: I just got it.."
"L: Did you cut them to that proper shape and everything, with the little flaps and all that?"
"W: Well I had it figured out.."
"L: Uh-huh"
"W: You know when I centered the thing, that there would be flaps on each side and I just figured out how to do it.. and I had it down to like a four-thing procedure..."
"L: Uh-huh"
"W: ...and I got these gluesticks..."
"L: Yeah, they're great! They're really great.."
"L: Oh god.. well we're gonna put them inside little plastic bags also I think.. so they don't fall apart.."
"W: Well you'll find that the plastic bags are expensive"
"L: Well Thurston said, like $25.. no wait, 25 for a dollar... so that would be like $40 for a thousand, that's not too expensive.."
"W: That's not too bad.."
