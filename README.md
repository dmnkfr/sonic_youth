# Repetition and Noise: The Words of Swans and Sonic Youth

In this project, I am exploring the lyrics of the NY noise rock bands __Swans__ and __Sonic Youth__ using NLP  and machine learning methods.

- The __code__ for this project is [here](https://github.com/dmnkfr/sonic_youth/blob/main/sy_swans.Rmd).

- The __rendered site__ without the code is [here](https://dmnkfr.github.io/sonic_youth/).

- The __app__ that tells you whether your own text sounds more like Swans or Sonic Youth is [here](https://dmnkfr.shinyapps.io/Swans_Sonic_Youth/).

If you have any __questions or feedback__, please don't hesitate to [contact me](https://dmnkfr.netlify.app/).
